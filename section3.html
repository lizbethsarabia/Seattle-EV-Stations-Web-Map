    <h1>Section 3</h1>
     <p>
      This project provides an interactive view of Seattle’s EV charging infrastructure, allowing users to explore where
      different types of charging stations are located and how access varies across neighborhoods. By combining spatial
      data with filters for connector type, charging level, network, and neighborhood, the map highlights patterns in
      charging availability and supports more informed decision making for EV drivers and planners.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    <p>
      The current distribution of EV stations shows strong coverage in central neighborhoods such as Downtown, Capitol
      Hill, Queen Anne, and the University District. However, some areas such as parts of West Seattle, Northgate, and South Seattle neighborhoods have fewer charging options. 
      These patterns highlight an uneven distribution of charging accessibility across the city,
      which is important for policymakers and city planners to understand. Addressing these gaps is essential for ensuring more equitable access to 
      EV infrastructure and supporting Seattle’s long-term sustainability and transportation goals. 
      The filtering tools make these disparities easier to see and help reveal where additional infrastructure may be needed.
    </p>

    <h2>Future Work</h2>
    <p>
      Looking ahead, several additions could further enhance the project’s functionality and impact:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Adding real time charger availability or outage status.</li>
      <li>Comparing EV station density with demographic data.</li>
      <li>Visualizing growth in EV infrastructure over time.</li>
      <li>Including routing features that guide users to the nearest compatible charger.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These additions would help build a more complete understanding of EV accessibility throughout Seattle and support 
      planning efforts as the demand for charging infrastructure continues to grow.
