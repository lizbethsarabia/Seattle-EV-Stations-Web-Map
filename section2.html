    <h1>Filter Design and Map Interaction</h1>
    <p> The interactive map of Seattle EV charging stations includes a filter panel that lets users explore the data 
      based on connector type, charging level, network provider, and neighborhood. These filters help users narrow down the map to find charging 
      options that meet their specific needs.</p>
    
    <hr>

    <h2>Connector Type Filter</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Connector Type</strong> filter lets users choose which plug types they want to see on the map. 
      Different EVs require different connectors, so this filter helps drivers find stations compatible with their 
      vehicle. Options include J1772, J1772Combo (CSS) , CHAdeMO, Tesla connectors, and NEMA 14-50 outlets. 
      Selecting a connector type hides all stations that do not offer that plug.
    </p>

    <h2>Charging Level Filter</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Charging Level</strong> filter focuses on how fast a station can charge a vehicle. Users can choose 
      between Level 1 (slow), Level 2 (moderate), and DC Fast (rapid charging). Selecting one of these levels shows only 
      stations that provide that specific charging speed. This helps users quickly locate fast chargers or browse slower 
      charging options.
    </p>
    <hr>
    
    <h2>Network Filter</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Network</strong> filter narrows results by charging provider. Many stations in Seattle belong to 
      networks such as ChargePoint, Tesla, Blink, Electrify America, and others. Drivers who have memberships, payment 
      accounts, or vehicle compatibility with certain networks can use this filter to view only the stations they 
      prefer or can access.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Neighborhood Filter</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Neighborhood</strong> filter allows users to view charging stations within a specific part of Seattle. 
      Choosing a neighborhood such as Capitol Hill, Ballard, Downtown, or Queen Anne, shows only the stations located 
      there. This helps users explore local charging availability, compare different areas, and identify neighborhood level 
      gaps or concentrations of EV infrastructure.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Apply and Reset Buttons</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Apply Filters</strong> button updates the map to show only the stations that match the selected 
      criteria.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>Reset</strong> button clears all filter selections and returns the map to the full, citywide view of 
      every EV station.
    </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Together, these filters make it easier for users to explore Seattle’s EV charging network. 
      Whether they want to find fast chargers, identify stations compatible with their specific connector type, focus 
      on a single network, or explore charging availability within individual neighborhoods, the filters provide a 
      an easy and effective wayto navigate the data.
