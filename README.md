# Geog328-Final-Project
For our final project, we plan on creating a web map that will visualize the spatial distribution, accessibility, and equity of electric vehicle charging stations and gas stations across Seattle. With EV adaptation rapidly growing, equitable access to charging infrastructure has become an important environmental justice and urban planning issue alongside existing gas stations. Our target audience includes Seattle residents interested in EV ownership, city planners and policy makers focused on sustainable infrastructure, and researchers studying transportation equity and urban design. It can also benefit EV owners who want to locate nearby charging stations within their neighborhoods. Overall, our project aims to make spatial data about EV infrastructure more understandable and engaging for a general audience serving as a practical tool for decision-making and future planning.

Available Data Sets: 
https://www.seattle.gov/city-light/energy/electrification/transportation-electrification/public-charging (Seattle City Light Public Charging Network Data)
https://www.plugshare.com/directory/us/washington/seattle-tacoma-bellevue (PlugShare EV Charging Station Data)
https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity-locations#/find/nearest?location=seattle&fuel=ELEC (US Department of Energy EV Data)

Multimedia: 

Station cover images that we are likely to use for this project may be sourced from OpenStreetMap and Google Maps to show what each station looks like in real life, to further help users visually confirm each station’s surroundings and accessibility before visiting.
Icons may be sourced from this website,  allowing each station type (EV, gas, or with a convenience store) to have its own distinct and visually clear icon. https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/electric-charging-station
