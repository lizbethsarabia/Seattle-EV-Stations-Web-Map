    <h1>Project Description</h1>
    <p>This project focuses on creating an interactive web mapping application that visualizes the spatial distribution, accessibility, and equity of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations and gas stations across Seattle.
       As EV adaptation is rapidly growing across Washington, equitable access to charging infrastructure has become an important environmental justice and urban planning issue alongside existing gas stations.
      This application allows users to explore where infrastructure is concentrated, where gaps exist, and how access varies across different neighborhoods.</p>

      <h2>Purpose and Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        Seattle is transitioning toward cleaner transportation systems, but access to EV charging is not evenly distributed.
        Understanding these spatial patterns can help support more equitable and sustainable planning. This project highlights
        how differences in EV charging availability impact daily mobility and broader transportation decisions.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Residents</strong> — determine whether EV ownership is realistic based on the availability of charging infrastructure in their neighborhoods</li>
        <li><strong>City planners and policymakers</strong> — identify where infrastructure investment is needed to support equitable and sustainable mobility</li>
        <li><strong>Researchers</strong> — analyze relationships between transportation equity, land use, and demographic variables</li>
        <li><strong>Current EV owners</strong> — quickly locate compatible charging stations near home, work, or travel routes</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        By centralizing these datasets and visual tools into one interactive map, our project supports informed decision-making,
        transportation planning, and environmental justice practices across the city.
